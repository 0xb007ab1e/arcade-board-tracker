## Definition of Ready Checklist

Before a user story is considered ready for implementation, it must meet the following criteria:

1. Story is clearly written with a proper user story format
2. Acceptance criteria are clearly defined
3. Story is estimated by the development team
4. Dependencies are identified and not blocking
5. Test cases are defined
6. Definition of Done is clear
7. Story is small enough to be completed in one sprint
8. UI mockups or wireframes are available (for UI stories)
9. Technical approach is understood by the team

## Definition of Done Checklist

A user story is considered done when:

1. All acceptance criteria are met
2. Code is written and reviewed
3. Tests are written and passing
4. Documentation is updated
5. Code is merged to the main branch
6. The feature is deployed to the staging environment
7. The product owner has accepted the implementation
8. No new defects are introduced

## Feature Request Parking Lot

The following feature requests have been identified but are outside the current scope. These should be addressed in future iterations:

1. **Mobile Application**: Native mobile app for technicians in the field
2. **Barcode/QR Code Scanning**: Scan board IDs for quick lookup
3. **AI Component Identification**: Use image recognition to identify components
4. **Parts Supplier Integration**: Connect with supplier APIs for part ordering
5. **Community Features**: Forum for sharing repair tips and knowledge
6. **Analytics Dashboard**: Advanced analytics on repair history and costs
7. **Inventory Forecasting**: Predict future inventory needs based on repair patterns
8. **Work Order System**: Create and track work orders for repairs

These feature requests should be reviewed after the initial application is successfully deployed and adopted by users.

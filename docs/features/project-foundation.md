# Project Foundation

## Feature Overview
The Project Foundation feature establishes the core infrastructure and configuration for the Arcade Board Tracker application. It includes the basic directory structure, server setup, development environment configuration, and database connection.

## User Stories Covered
- User Story 1.1: Project Repository Setup
- User Story 1.2: Development Environment Configuration
- User Story 1.3: Basic Express Server Setup
- User Story 1.4: Database Connection

## Implementation Details

### Directory Structure
- `server/`: Backend Node.js application
  - `config/`: Configuration files for database, server, etc.
  - `controllers/`: Route handlers
  - `models/`: Database models
  - `routes/`: API endpoint definitions
  - `middleware/`: Custom middleware functions
  - `utils/`: Utility functions
  - `uploads/`: File storage directory
- `client/`: Frontend React application (placeholder)
- `docs/`: Documentation files
- `tests/`: Test files

### Server Configuration
- Express.js server with appropriate middleware
- CORS configuration
- JSON parsing
- Request logging
- Error handling middleware
- Health check endpoint

### Development Environment

- Nodemon for auto-restart during development
- Environment variable configuration
- NPM scripts for various tasks

### Database Connection
- MongoDB connection using Mongoose
- Connection error handling
- Database configuration based on environment
- Connection logging

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for configuration loading
- Integration tests for database connection
- API tests for health check endpoint
- Validation of environment variable handling

## Definition of Done

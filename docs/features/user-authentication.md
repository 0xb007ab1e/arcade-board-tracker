# User Authentication System

## Feature Overview
The User Authentication System provides secure user registration, login, and access control for the Arcade Board Tracker application. It includes user model definition, authentication endpoints, JWT token handling, and role-based authorization.

## User Stories Covered
- User Story 1.5: User Model Implementation
- User Story 1.6: User Registration Endpoint
- User Story 1.7: User Login Endpoint
- User Story 1.8: Authentication Middleware
- User Story 2.5: User Roles and Permissions

## Implementation Details

### User Model
- Schema with username, email, password, role
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Timestamps for user creation and updates
- Methods for password validation
- JWT token generation

### Authentication Endpoints
- Registration endpoint with validation
- Login endpoint with credential verification
- Profile retrieval endpoint
- Profile update endpoint
- Password reset functionality (optional)

### JWT Implementation
- Token generation with appropriate payload
- Token verification middleware
- Token expiration handling
- Refresh token strategy (optional)

### Authorization System
- Role-based access control (Admin, Technician, Viewer)
- Role checking middleware
- Permission validation for resources
- Owner-based access control

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for User model methods
- Unit tests for password hashing and validation
- Integration tests for registration endpoint
- Integration tests for login endpoint
- Integration tests for authentication middleware
- Integration tests for role-based access control
- Security tests for token handling

## Definition of Done
- User model correctly stores and validates user data
- Passwords are securely hashed
- Registration endpoint creates new users and returns tokens
- Login endpoint validates credentials and returns tokens
- JWT tokens are securely generated and validated
- Authentication middleware correctly protects routes
- Role-based access control works as expected
- All user operations maintain data security
- No sensitive information is exposed in responses
- All tests pass successfully
- API documentation includes authentication details

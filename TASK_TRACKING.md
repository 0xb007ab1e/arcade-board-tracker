## Progress Tracking

### Daily Standup Template

For each day, team members should provide the following information:

1. What did I accomplish yesterday?
2. What will I work on today?
3. Are there any blockers or issues?

### Burndown Chart

The burndown chart will be updated daily to track progress against the sprint goals. The chart will show:

- Total story points planned for the sprint
- Ideal burndown line
- Actual story points completed each day

## Notes and Decisions

This section will be used to record important decisions and notes that affect the project implementation.

### Technical Decisions

- MongoDB chosen for flexible schema to accommodate different component types
- JWT authentication for stateless API design
- React for frontend to allow component reuse across different views
- File uploads stored locally for initial version, with plans to migrate to cloud storage later

### Process Decisions

- Daily standups at 10:00 AM
- Sprint planning on first Monday of sprint
- Sprint review on last Friday of sprint
- Code reviews required for all PRs
- Test coverage target: 80% minimum

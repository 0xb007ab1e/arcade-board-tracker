# How to Disable Vercel Authentication Protection

The Vercel Authentication Protection is a security feature that requires users to log in before accessing your application. This feature is applied at the project or team level and cannot be bypassed with code modifications alone.

## Steps to Disable Protection in Vercel Dashboard

1. **Log in to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Sign in with your account

2. **Go to Project Settings**
   - Select the "arcade-board-tracker" project
   - Click on "Settings" in the top navigation bar

3. **Find Security Settings**
   - In the left sidebar, look for "Security" or "Access Control"
   - You might find it under "General" â†’ "Protection" or similar section

4. **Disable Protection**
   - Turn off "Password Protection" or "Vercel Authentication"
   - Save the changes

5. **Re-deploy Your Application**
   - After disabling protection, trigger a new deployment
   - You can do this by clicking "Redeploy" in the project dashboard

## Alternative: Use Bypass URL

If you prefer to keep the protection enabled but need to access your API, you can:

1. Log in once through the Vercel Authentication flow
2. After authenticating, you'll have access to the API and can test it directly

The authentication token will be stored in your browser, allowing you to access protected pages for that session.

## If You Can't Access Dashboard Settings

If you can't access the Vercel dashboard settings, you might need to:

1. Create a new project without protection
2. Push your code to the new project

You can create a new project using:

```bash
vercel --name arcade-board-tracker-public
```

This will create a new deployment without the protection settings from your original project.

## JWT Bypass Token

We've also implemented a JWT bypass token system that may work in some scenarios. Use the token generated by the `generateBypassToken.js` script to access protected endpoints:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6ImJ5cGFzcy11c2VyIiwicm9sZSI6ImFkbWluIiwicHVycG9zZSI6InZlcmNlbC1hdXRoLWJ5cGFzcyIsImlhdCI6MTc1MDk5ODMxMCwiZXhwIjoxNzgyNTU1OTEwfQ.unZGVYV69MfX2vAv_-6JD-2hXD2K1t-THDWfOdrssL8
```

Add this token to your API requests using:

```
?bypassToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6ImJ5cGFzcy11c2VyIiwicm9sZSI6ImFkbWluIiwicHVycG9zZSI6InZlcmNlbC1hdXRoLWJ5cGFzcyIsImlhdCI6MTc1MDk5ODMxMCwiZXhwIjoxNzgyNTU1OTEwfQ.unZGVYV69MfX2vAv_-6JD-2hXD2K1t-THDWfOdrssL8
```

or as a header:

```
X-Vercel-Bypass: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6ImJ5cGFzcy11c2VyIiwicm9sZSI6ImFkbWluIiwicHVycG9zZSI6InZlcmNlbC1hdXRoLWJ5cGFzcyIsImlhdCI6MTc1MDk5ODMxMCwiZXhwIjoxNzgyNTU1OTEwfQ.unZGVYV69MfX2vAv_-6JD-2hXD2K1t-THDWfOdrssL8
```

However, this will only work if the Vercel Authentication happens after your application code runs.
